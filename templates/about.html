                    I grew up in Seaside, CA and go to school at Santa Clara Univeristy where I am working on my Master's in mechanical engineering. I enjoy being active and have always loved playing competitive sports. I played football and lacrosse in high school and was lucky enough to play college-level lacrosse. Now that I no longer play organized sports, I spend most of my time at the beach playing volleyball or surfing.

                    With the interest of improving my own surfing, I started to design and build my own surfboards. I really enjoy applying my knowledge of fluid dynamics to try to come up with better designs. I am still learning the craft and have started working at Almar Surf in Santa Cruz. I enjoy the process of making a surfboard and really care about the small details. My goal is to build high quality surfboards that won't end up in a dumpster somewhere.
